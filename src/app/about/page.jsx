      <h1>ABOUT MGC CONSTRUCTION</h1>
      <p className="w-40">
        Construction is committed to being the best builder in the industry. We
        continually strive to exceed industry norms in project performance,
        client retention and team member satisfaction. To that end, we believe
        that perfection is a worthy – and attainable – pursuit. We continually
        and methodically seek ways to add value to our clients’ projects and to
        deliver unexpected results. The goal is 100% customer satisfaction,
        whether the customer is a new client, repeat client, design or
        engineering partner, building user, subcontractor, tradesperson or
        employee. We are always reaching for that perfect 10, or the highest
        level, on everything we do. Sometimes the process yields big,
        company-wide improvements that touch every project; other times the
        process provides incremental improvements that are project- or
        client-specific. Either way, we are continually improving and making
        ourselves more valuable as builders.
